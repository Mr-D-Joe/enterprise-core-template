# SYSTEM REPORT — [Project Name]
# =============================

⚠️ NON-NORMATIVE / DESCRIPTIVE DOCUMENT

This document is a **System Report**.

It is:
- DESCRIPTIVE (Describes what is)
- NON-NORMATIVE (Does not define what must be)
- NON-AUTHORITATIVE (Derived from observation)
- REGENERATABLE (Snapshot in time)

It MUST NOT define rules, architecture, or constraints.

---

## DOCUMENT ORIGIN

This document is generated by an LLM (e.g. Gemini / Anti-Gravity) based on:
- Current codebase observation
- Runtime behavior
- DESIGN.md constitution

It represents an **observed system state**, not an intended design.

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

The System Report serves to:
- Describe the current technical state of the system for human and machine readers.
- Facilitate audits against DESIGN.md by providing a clear "actual" state to compare with the "target" state.
- Provide traceability between the constitution (DESIGN.md) and the implementation.

# SYSTEM REPORT GOVERNANCE EFFECT

This System Report standard ensures:

## For LLM Systems
LLMs use this structure to generate reports without introducing normative rules, strictly referencing DESIGN.md as the authority.

## For Automated Test Systems
Test systems use this structure to validate that strictly descriptive language is employed.

## For Humans
Humans use this report to understand the reality of the system implementation without mistaking it for the design authority.
