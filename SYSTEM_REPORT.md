# SYSTEM REPORT — Enterprise Core Template

> **⚠️ NON-NORMATIVE / DESCRIPTIVE DOCUMENT**
>
> This document is a **System Report**.
>
> It is:
> - DESCRIPTIVE (Describes what is)
> - NON-NORMATIVE (Does not define what must be)
> - NON-AUTHORITATIVE (Derived from observation)
> - REGENERATABLE (Snapshot in time)
>
> It MUST NOT define rules, architecture, or constraints.

## DOCUMENT ORIGIN

This document is generated by an LLM (e.g. Gemini / Anti-Gravity) based on:
- Current codebase observation
- Runtime behavior
- DESIGN.md constitution

It represents an **observed system state**, not an intended design.

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

The System Report serves to:
- Describe the current technical state of the system for human and machine readers.
- Facilitate audits against DESIGN.md by providing a clear "actual" state to compare with the "target" state.
- Provide traceability between the constitution (DESIGN.md) and the implementation.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**{{PROJECT_NAME}}** is a **{{APP_TYPE}}** that functions as **{{CORE_PURPOSE}}**.

The system demonstrates a focus on:
- {{PRIORITY_1}}
- {{PRIORITY_2}}
- {{PRIORITY_3}}

---

## 2. System Architecture

### Observed Architecture Style

{{ARCH_STYLE}}

### Observed Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | {{FRONTEND_TECH}} |
| Backend | {{BACKEND_TECH}} |
| Styling | {{STYLING_TECH}} |

---

## 3. Module Overview

> **Note:** Detailed module inspection is intentionally omitted in this report style. This report focuses on architectural compliance.

---

## 4. Compliance with DESIGN.md

### Observed Compliance

- {{COMPLIANCE_ITEM_1}} (Matches {{DES_REF_1}})
- {{COMPLIANCE_ITEM_2}} (Matches {{DES_REF_2}})

### Not Yet Implemented

- {{MISSING_FEATURE_1}}
- {{MISSING_FEATURE_2}}

---

## 5. Risk Summary

| Area | Risk | Observation |
|------|------|-------------|
| {{RISK_AREA}} | {{RISK_DESCRIPTION}} | {{RISK_CONTEXT}} |

---

## 6. Final Assessment

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Internal consistency | {{YES_NO}} |
| Extensibility | {{YES_NO}} |
| Production readiness | {{YES_NO}} |

**Verdict:** {{VERDICT_SUMMARY}}

## SYSTEM REPORT GOVERNANCE EFFECT

This System Report standard ensures:

### For LLM Systems
LLMs use this structure to generate reports without introducing normative rules, strictly referencing DESIGN.md as the authority.

### For Automated Test Systems
Test systems use this structure to validate that strictly descriptive language is employed.

### For Humans
Humans use this report to understand the reality of the system implementation without mistaking it for the design authority.
