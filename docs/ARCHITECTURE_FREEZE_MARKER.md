# ARCHITECTURE FREEZE MARKER

> **STATUS: FROZEN**  
> **Effective Date:** {{DATE}}

The core architecture of this system is **FROZEN**.

## What does this mean?

1. **No Unexpected New Layers:** AI Agents and Developers must NOT introduce new frameworks (e.g., Global State Libs, GraphQL, Docker) without an explicit update to `DESIGN.md`.
2. **Strict Pattern Adherence:** The patterns defined in `DESIGN.md` (e.g., Mock-First, Token-Budgeting) are binding.
3. **Constitution First:** Any architectural change requires a formal amendment to `DESIGN.md` *before* code implementation.
